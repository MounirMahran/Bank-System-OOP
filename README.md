# Bank-System-OOP
Using OOP, libraries and repositories I have done. I created Bank System and added many more features and functions.
OOP enabled me to expand the project as much as I wanted.
Some features was hard to be done in regular functional programming has been done in minutes and much less code lines using OOP.
I added functions like log files for transactions and logins.
The project got more realistic and practical.
The four principels of OOP Abstracion, encapsulation, inheritence and polymorphism was really helpful and meaningful in pratice.
